      <para>
	The only virtual machine (VM) we test the installation process on is
	<firstterm>KVM</firstterm>. Hence, this is the only VM officially supported by
	Qlustar. Furthermore, while nesting of VMs is supported, it will be rather slow to
	start a virtual front-end node or a virtual demo-cluster directly from within a
	head-node that is itself running as a VM.
      </para>
    </note>
    <note>
      <para>
	The Qlustar kernel is configured for cluster server hardware. Hence, it's possible,
	that drivers for some network or storage adapters on Laptops or other non-server PCs
	are missing. If you run into such problems, please post it in the <link
	xlink:href="https://lists.qlustar.org/postorius/lists/qlustar-general.qlustar.org/___blank___">
	Qlustar Mailing List</link>. At this stage, Qlustar also has no support for secure boot
	(UEFI). If your hardware uses UEFI by default, you need to configure your BIOS to allow
	so-called <firstterm>legacy boot</firstterm>.
      </para>
    </note>
  </chapter>

  <chapter xml:id="Load-to-USB">
    <title>Loading the installer to a USB flash-drive</title>
    <para>
      The Qlustar installer is provided as an ISO image, that can be burned onto a DVD or be
      loaded onto a USB flash-drive. This section explains the USB method. If you already have
      an up-to-date Qlustar USB drive you can skip this step. But make sure that you have the
      latest installer to be found at <link
      xlink:href="https://qlustar.com/download/___blank___">the Qlustar website</link>.
    </para>
    <important>
      <para>
	After downloading the installer image, verify its integrity, by executing
	the following command:
	<screen>
<prompt>0 user@workstation ~ $ </prompt>
<command>sha256sum qlustar-installer.iso.gz</command>
	</screen>
	Now compare the such-generated checksum with the value that is published at the above
	download page. If the checksums are not identical, do not proceed with the
	installation, since that means the installer is corrupt (either due to hardware errors
	or a malicious attack). In this case, you should download the image once more. If the
	problem persists, also after downloading from a different computer, please post the
	incidence in the <link
	xlink:href="https://lists.qlustar.org/postorius/lists/qlustar-general.qlustar.org/___blank___">
	Qlustar Mailing List</link>.
    </para>
    </important>
    <para>
      The instructions in this guide only apply to the latest version. With the downloaded
      disk image you can easily create a bootable drive under Linux as follows (note that
      the USB drive should have a minimum size of 2GB): Given that the downloaded installer
      image file is named <filename>qlustar-installer.iso.gz</filename> and that the
      device name of the drive is <filename>/dev/sdb</filename>, the following command 
      (executed as root) will load the image to the flash-drive:
      <screen>
<prompt>0 root@workstation ~ # </prompt>
<command>gunzip -c qlustar-installer.iso.gz | dd of=/dev/sdb</command>
      </screen>
    </para>
    <para>
      Depending on the speed of your flash-drive, this can take up to 20 minutes.
    </para>
    <warning>
      <para>
	The above command will destroy all data on the USB drive or to be more precise, it will
	destroy the data of the device named <filename>/dev/sdb</filename>!  So make sure to
	find out the correct device name of the drive.
      </para>
    </warning>
    <para>
      This can be achieved e.g. by executing the command
    <screen>
<prompt>0 root@workstation ~ # </prompt>
<command>tail -f /var/log/kern.log</command>
    </screen>
    </para>
    <para>
      at the shell prompt before you insert the drive. Just after you have inserted it, a
      message like
      <screen>
<computeroutput>[sdb] Attached SCSI removable disk</computeroutput>
      </screen>
      should appear. In this case your USB drive would have the device name
      <filename>/dev/sdb</filename>. If the above <command>dd</command> command finished
      successfully, you can use the drive to install the Qlustar OS on the target machine. This
      is described in the next paragraph.

	  <para>
	    Insert the drive into the server that you want to install the Qlustar OS on and
	    boot. Make sure to select the USB drive as the boot device, either by entering the
	    BIOS and changing the boot order, or by entering a boot menu and then selecting the

	    install via a <firstterm>serial console</firstterm> (e.g. IPMI serial-over-LAN),
	    select the correct entry <replaceable>(ttyS0/1/2)</replaceable> depending on your
	    hardware setup. Press <keycap>Enter</keycap> to start the installation. After the
	    kernel was loaded, you will see the kernel messages on the screen followed by some

	    In this screen you can select the disk(s) to install Qlustar on.  If there is
	    more than one disk in the system, you can select multiple disks and create a
	    RAID array (different RAID levels can be chosen depending on the number of the
	    disks available). The chosen disk (or created RAID device) will then be used
	    as a LVM physical volume to create a LVM volume group (the name of which can
	    be specified). Four ext4 file-systems <filename>(root, var, tmp, apps)</filename>
	    will automatically be created on equally named LVM logical volumes within this

	    additional file-system. If you choose <guimenuitem>"Other"</guimenuitem>, then no
	    configuration for a home file-system will be done. In this case, you won't be able

	    In this screen, you configure the IP addresses for the cluster and public
	    network. The installer has some logic to check for valid network configuration
	    parameters as well as suggesting reasonable values. The chosen number of
	    compute nodes <replaceable>NK</replaceable> in the cluster determines the suggested
	    cluster network address and other parameters. It doesn't have to be accurate,
	    just an approximate number will do.
	  </para>
	  <note>
	  <para>
	    Note that Qlustar requires cluster-internal IP networks to be in a <emphasis
	    role="bold">non-public</emphasis> range. If you're unhappy with the range
	    suggested, you can change NK to another number (e.g. NK=1000 suggests 10.x.x.x,
	    NK=200 172.16.x.x and NK=16 192.168.x.x).

	  </para>
	  <para>
	    It's important that you correctly identify external (public/access to the Internet)
	    and internal (cluster) network adapters. If you select DHCP as the configuration

	    corresponding Network Config in the graphical <link

	    Postfix is running on the head-node as the central <emphasis role="bold"> mail

	    resolvable via DNS or by IP) in your LAN, where mail of the cluster will be
	    accepted and redistributed. Root mails generated on the cluster, will be redirected
	    to a list of e-mail addresses, that you can enter next (multiple addresses should
	    be separated by a comma). Having a correctly functioning mail setup is required to
	    receive monitoring messages.

	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If there are nodes with IB, you first need to set the option whether
	    the head-node itself also has IB hardware or not. If it doesn't, you only need to

	    Otherwise, you have the additional choice to run <command>OpenSM</command> (IB
	    subnet manager) on the head-node. Note, that at least one node (or switch) in an IB
	    fabric has to run a subnet manager. Given the value of the IB network address, the
	    host part of the IB adapter's IP address will be set from the host part of the
	    Ethernet address of the node in the cluster network. Example: IP cluster network
	    192.168.52.100 - IP IB network 192.168.53.100 (see also the <link

	    As with IB, if some of the nodes of your cluster have an IPMI adapter that is
	    connected to a switch, you can enter the network address parameters that will be
	    used to configure its IP address. Again, the host part of the IPMI adapter's IP
	    will be derived from its cluster network IP (see above). Additional, host specific
	    IPMI configuration options can be set in <link

	    <note>

	    For the sake of system stability and performance, it is usually a good idea to
	    <emphasis role="bold">separate user from system activities</emphasis> as much
	    as possible. To achieve this, we suggest to run only system-related tasks
	    directly on the cluster's head-node(s) and have physical or virtual front-end

	    In this dialog you can choose to setup a <emphasis role="bold">virtual FE
	    node</emphasis> as a virtual machine running on the head-node. If you decide not to
	    do so, we advise to assign a physical machine as a FE node at a later stage. The
	    suggestions for the network parameters of the FE VM are derived from the
	    head-node's values. Again, if you select DHCP as the configuration method for the
	    public interface, make sure to add its IP address later to the corresponding
	    Network Config in the graphical <link
	    xlink:href="../QluMan_Guide/index.html#sec-Network-Configs___blank___">QluMan
	    management interface</link>. The cluster node name of this FE node will be
	    <code>login-c</code>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    You also have the option to create a <emphasis role="bold">virtual demo-cluster
	    </emphasis> on the head-node, provided the latter has enough RAM. When choosing
	    the number of demo-nodes, keep in mind, that each one of them will be configured
	    with 1.5GB of main memory. Even if configured, the VMs will not be started
	    automatically though, so the head-node will be able to boot, even if an insane
	    number of demo VMs are chosen.
	  </para>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      If you choose neither the option for the virtual FE node, nor the virtual
	      demo-cluster, the necessary network pre-configurations (bridge setup, etc.) for
	      starting VMs will not be done. This means, that you'll have to do a number of
	      non-trivial manual steps after installation, in case you find out, that you need
	      support for VMs later on.
	    </para>

	      If you intend to follow all the instructions in the

	    </para>
	  </note>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      Simply configuring a virtual demo-cluster doesn't consume any resources of the
	      head-node apart from a little bit of disk space (in form of LVM logical volumes),
	      so it doesn't harm to do so. If you later want to get rid of it, just delete the
	      LVM volumes and the nodes in QluMan.

		  Technically, choosing a specific edge platform (e.g. Ubuntu/Xenial) will
		  cause Qlustar images based on Ubuntu/Xenial to be created along with an
		  associated chroot during the installation process. This chroot will hold a
		  complete Ubuntu/Xenial installation in which you can <link
		  xlink:href="../First_Steps_Guide/index.html#sec-Adding-Software___blank___">add
		  packages</link> later on. By assigning this Qlustar image later to some
		  nodes in QluMan, you will have a <emphasis

		  them, once they will have booted over the network.

		  The default installation will only install a minimal set of basic packages on
