    <title>Adding Hosts</title>
    <para>
      To add new hosts to the cluster you can either select "New Hosts" from the context menu
      in the Enclosure View tree or from the "Manage Hosts" menu. This opens the "Hosts
      Window".
      <!--cbox(file: new_host_window.png)-->
    </para>
    <para>
      Adding a new host requires the specification of an IP address, hostname and MAC in the
      corresponding three text fields of the dialog. The entered values are checked for
      their validity. If one of them is not valid, the check-box to its right remains
      cleared <!--checkbox_unchecked.png-->.  The tool-tip of the check-box will then show,
      why it is invalid. If all the values are valid, all check-boxes will show a solid
      check <!--checkbox_checked.png--> and the <guibutton>Add Host</guibutton> button will
      become selectable. For convenience and if it makes sense, the IP address and the
      numeric part of the hostname (if there is one) will automatically be incremented by
      one, after a host was added. So in most cases, these fields will not have to be
      changed manually to add the next host. Only the new MAC will need to be entered.
    </para>
    <para>
      <!--cbox(file: new_host_window-select.png)-->
      To help adding new hosts, qlumand scans the <filename>DHCP log file</filename> for
      unknown hosts that have requested an IP address. For each unknown host found in the
      logs, the table at the top of the window shows the time of the first and last
      appearance in the log, its MAC address as well as the hardware vendor this MAC is
      assigned too (if known). Selecting a MAC in the table copies it into the MAC text field
      at the bottom and a double-click adds the host with the selected MAC. One can also
      select multiple lines (by holding the <keycap>CTRL</keycap> key and clicking or holding
      the <keycap>shift</keycap> key and dragging the mouse) and then click the
      <guibutton>Add Selected</guibutton> button at the bottom to add them all using the
      auto-increment feature for the IP address and hostname. If unsure, try adding a single
      host first and check the auto-increment does the right thing before adding a group of
      hosts. One easy way to add groups of hosts is to power them on one at a time with a
      <!--cbox(file: new_host_window-template.png)-->
      short delay (say 30 seconds). The hosts will then appear in the Unknown MACs table in
      the order they were powered on and can be added as a group with the click of a single
      button.
    </para>
    <para>
      At the bottom of the window a <xref linkend="Host-Templates" endterm="Host-Templates"/>
      can be selected that will be used as the default for new hosts. Most of the time, no
      additional configuration is needed for a new host.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="sec-Configuring-Hosts">
    <title>Configuring Hosts</title>
    <para>
      The configuration of a host consists of the definition and assignment of different
      types of properties and config classes. Properties are always a key + value pair and
      are further split into generic, hardware and specific properties.
    </para>
    <bridgehead xml:id="Hardware-Properties">Hardware Properties</bridgehead>
    <para>
      <literal>Hardware properties</literal> are used to describe the hardware of a
      host. Amongst others, hardware properties like the amount of RAM or number of CPU cores
      are used to configure resource management systems like slurm or torque, so jobs can be
      assigned to the desired hosts. Others, like e.g. the server model or BIOS version, are
      purely informational and might be used for inventory management.
    </para>
    <bridgehead xml:id="Generic-Properties">Generic Properties</bridgehead>
    <para>
      A property that is not hardware related and not specific to a host is called generic.
      <literal>Generic properties</literal> can be configuration options, like 'OpenSM Host',
      or purely informational, like 'Paid by'. While hardware properties are meant to be more
      rigid typically with a configurable set of fixed values, generic properties are more
      flexible and can be defined at will. This will become more apparent in future versions
      of <application>QluMan</application>. <literal>Generic properties</literal> are also
      not necessarily unique, making it possible to assign multiple values for a single
      generic property. This is useful e.g. to add multiple torque host tags or to put hosts
      in multiple groups for dsh/pdsh (via the 'Host tag').
    </para>
    <bridgehead xml:id="Specific-Properties">Specific Properties</bridgehead>
    <para>
      As the name suggests, <literal>specific properties</literal> are specific to a single
      host. The best example for such a property is the serial number of the host.
    </para>
    <bridgehead xml:id="PropConf-Sets">Property/Config Sets</bridgehead>
    <para>
      <!--cbox(file: enclosure_view__select_template.png)-->
      Individual generic properties, hardware properties and config classes can be used to
      define generic property sets, hardware property sets and config sets. This is simply a
      means of grouping them together so they can be used as a single entity. A <literal>Host
      Template</literal> can then be created by choosing one generic property set, one
      hardware property set and one config set.
    </para>
    <bridgehead xml:id="Host-Templates">Host Templates</bridgehead>
    <para>
      When a correct <literal>Host Template</literal> exists, a host can be configured by
      selecting the desired template in the <classname>Enclosure View</classname> window.
      For a single host, this can be done by selecting it in the tree view. This brings up
      the host <!--cbox(file: enclosure_view__select_template2.png)--> information on the left and
      the template can be selected from the drop-down menu. To configure multiple hosts, you
      would select them in the tree view and choose a <literal>Host Template</literal> from
      the context menu. The check-marks in the sub-menu indicate which <literal>Host
      Templates</literal> are currently assigned (if any) for the selected nodes. This action
      will override the previous assignment.
    </para>
    <para>
      <literal>Generic properties</literal> can also be assigned to a host individually. Such
      assigned properties take precedence over ones of the same type selected through the
      <literal>Host Template</literal>. This is useful when a property should be changed
      temporarily for some hosts or when a property should not be
      <!--cbox(file: enclosure_view__select_generic_property.png)-->
      changeable globally through the Host Template. Note that by default, every new host has
      the generic property <parameter>Schedule Format: always</parameter>, which is required
      to format the disk on the first boot. This should be removed after the first successful
      boot of the host so that log files will be preserved across boots in the future.
