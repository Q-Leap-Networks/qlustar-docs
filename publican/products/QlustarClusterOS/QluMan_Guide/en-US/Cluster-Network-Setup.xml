  <title>Cluster Network Setup</title>
  <para>
    Starting from Qlustar 10, the configuration of networks has been reimplemented and become a
    lot more powerful. An arbitrary number of networks of different types and with different
    properties can now be configured for a cluster. There is a new network config class that
    allows networks to be grouped in any number of network configs. The idea is, that any such
    network config reflects the network adapter configuration of a single or a group of
    nodes. Finally such a network config can be assigned to <link
    linkend="PropConf-Sets">Config Sets</link> or directly to cluster
    nodes. According to the chosen network config for a node, individual node network
    properties like IP or MAC addresses can then be assigned to the node in the <link
    linkend="sec-Enclosure-View-Network-Info">Enclosure View</link>.

      During the installation of Qlustar, the basic configuration parameters for the cluster
      network had to be entered. Often, additional networks need to be defined later. This
      can be accomplished within the networks dialog selectable via <guibutton>Manage
      Cluster</guibutton>-><guibutton>Networks</guibutton> from the main windows menu.

      The Networks window displays all defined networks each in a separate tab. Each tab shows
      all the configurable parameter that define the corresponding network. The base settings
      of a network are its IP address and netmask as well as an optional gateway
      address. QluMan distinguishes two types of networks: <firstterm>Primary
      Networks</firstterm> and <firstterm>Slave Networks</firstterm>.
    </para>
    <para>
      A primary network is one that determines the IP address of a host using one of the
      options listed in the <guilabel>Configure via</guilabel> section of the dialog. The
      available options are:
      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>
	    DHCP (boot)
	  </term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Configuration via the DHCP server running on the head-node. This allows the host
	      to boot over the network using PXE. Every cluster must have one such network and
	      it is created automatically during the Qlustar installation process according to
	      the data provided from the installer.
	    </para>

	      Configuration by an external DHCP server not under the control of QluMan. This
	      option only makes sense for nodes that have an adapter connected to a
	      cluster-external network, like e.g. a cluster FrontEnd node.

    <para>    
      A slave network on the other hand, is tied to a primary network. The idea is, that the IP
      of a host in the slave network is determined by mapping the host part of the IP in the
      primary network into the network range of the slave network. In most cases, this means
      that the host IP of the primary and slave networks end in the same number. This is a
      convenient feature, mostly used for Infiniband and IPMI networks. It saves you from
      registering/managing additional MAC/IP addresses and makes IPs easily recognizable as
      belonging to the same host.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
	This mechanism requires the netmask of the slave network to be at least as large as the
	primary network it is slaved to. Hence, the GUI prevents smaller values to be selected.

      Qlustar uses network-booting via PXE to start nearly all hosts in the cluster. The only
      system(s) that can not be network-booted is the <firstterm>head-node(s)</firstterm>
      itself. Every cluster should therefore have a network that is a <guibutton>Primary
      Network</guibutton> and configured via <guibutton>DHCP (boot)</guibutton>. Such a network
      is created by the Qlustar installer and called <classname>Boot</classname>. Changes to
      this network are rarely necessary but if changes were made, all nodes must be rebooted to
      get the updated configuration.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
	Changing the network address or mask may also require additional manual changes in the
	config of hosts booting from disk, specifically the <firstterm>head-node</firstterm>
	itself.

    <para>
      Individual IP addresses and MACs of a host can be configured in the <link

      assigned to a network config. As with other settings/configs, this assignment can also be
      done in the <link linkend="sec-Enclosure-View-Other-Settings">Enclosure View</link> by
      assigning a network config in one of the usual ways (direct assignment, host or global

      </mediaobject>
      The GUI has some safeguards to prevent invalid network configurations. For example
      different networks must not overlap. Attempting to change the network address so that it
      overlaps another network won't be accepted: The <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button at the
      bottom of the window will be disabled and a red LED icon will appear with a tool-tip
      explaining why the selected configuration is not allowed.
    </para>
    <para>
      When changing the network IP address or netmask, the IP addresses of all hosts configured
      to be in that network will be remapped to reflect the changed values. This requires that
      a new netmask is large enough, so that the resulting network range can include all
      existing hosts in the cluster. Therefore, the GUI won't let you pick anything too
      small. If there are unused address ranges in the existing network and you need a smaller
      netmask than currently selectable, you will first have to change some host addresses so
      that all of them combined occupy a small enough subset of the current network.
    </para>
    <para>
      Changing the network address IP will automatically remap the cluster internal Head IP
      address as well, while changing the netmask will not. Note, that the Qlustar
      convention, to use the second last IP of the cluster network as the Head IP, is
      obviously not a requirement. Hence, this is not done automatically when changing the
      netmask. Furthermore, changing the Head IP involves some additional steps without which
      the nodes in the cluster won't function or even boot. The reason is that the Head IP
      also appears in the <classname>Global DHCP Template</classname> and may have been added
      to other templates too. These templates are simple, freely editable text blobs. A
      change of the network definitions will not change them, so you need to check and adjust
      each of them manually.
    </para>
    <para>
      Changes to the networks definition have wide-ranging effects. To prevent accidental
      changes or booting hosts while in between configurations any changes to the network are
      not saved instantly. Instead the <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button at the bottom of the
      window needs to be clicked to confirm the changes. Alternatively, the
      <guibutton>Undo</guibutton> button can be used to revert any changes to the last saved
      values. Any changes to a network must be saved or reverted before switching tabs or
      closing the window.

      If the head-node does not have direct access to the Internet, a <parameter>http
      proxy</parameter> must be configured. QluMan uses this proxy to download packages from
      the <guilabel>Qlustar repository</guilabel>, when creating a new chroot. The HTTP proxy
      can be configured under <guimenuitem>Manage Cluster</guimenuitem>-><guimenuitem>Global
      Configs</guimenuitem>-><guimenuitem>Network Settings</guimenuitem> (<xref

    <bridgehead>
      Configuring slave networks
    </bridgehead>
    <para>
      For convenience, in a cluster with Infiniband and/or IPMI, the corresponding networks are
      usually setup to mirror the Boot network: If the Boot IP of a host ends in .10 then the
      Infiniband and IPMI IPs will usually also end in .10. Within QluMan, this relationship
      can be set up by configuring these special networks as a slave to the Boot network: In
      the tab of the network under consideration, simply select the network to be slaved to
      from the drop-down menu.
    </para>
    <para>
       In a slave network, the IP of a host is always derived from its IP in the network it is
       slaved to. During the initial part of a node's boot process, the qluman-execd writes the
       resulting static slave network information into the relevant configuration file, so that
       the adapter will later be configured via standard OS methods. Hence, the IPs in the
       slave network don't need to be set for each host individually.
    </para>
    <para>
      The hostnames corresponding to the IPs in the slave network are also under control of
      this mechanism. The name of a host in a slave network will be auto generated using the
      QluMan node name of the host as the stem and adding a prefix and/or postfix separated by
      a dash to it. The default Infiniband network setup for example has a postfix of
      <emphasis>ib</emphasis>, meaning a host named <parameter>beo-01</parameter> will be
      reachable on the Infiniband network as <parameter>beo-01-ib</parameter>. Such
      pre-/postfixes may be set/changed in the configuration dialog of the network.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        Hostnames generated by QluMan are added to the DHCP (boot network only), NIS and ssh
        configs allowing them to be used within the cluster where necessary.

      As part of the above mentioned reimplementation of QluMan network configuration
      management, a new config class <classname>Network Config</classname> has been added. It
      allows combining multiple network definitions (as described <link
      linkend="sec-Network-Definitions">above</link>) and link each of them to a physical
      adapter. Like any other config class, such a Network Config may
      then be assigned to the Global Template, Host Templates, Config Sets or individually to
      hosts. Every host must have exactly one assigned Network Config which must match its
      hardware (adapter names).
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        Hosts with different types of network adapters may need different Network Configs even
        if they are connected to the same networks, because the hardware specific
        network adapter name of each NIC can differ between these hosts.

      host, then the boot network will already have a Host IP and MAC address filled in. Both
      of these are required for the host to be able to boot from the network and to receive the
      correct configuration at boot.

      For networks that use <literal>DHCP(boot)</literal> to configure the network adapter, the
      correct MAC address must be given. It must be entered as six hexadecimal bytes separated

      <guilabel>MAC</guilabel> label will show whether the entered MAC address is valid,
      although most invalid input is rejected by the GUI outright. For networks defined as

      The last part of a host's network settings are optional host aliases. These are simply
      alternative names under which the host can be reached and which will be added to the NIS

      unique. For performance reasons, the uniqueness is not fully checked by the GUI, so care
      must be taken to avoid collisions.

  <section xml:id="sec-Hostnames">
    <title>Names of a Host</title>
    <para>
      A host can have multiple names. Typically there is at least one name for each network it
      is connected to. The primary name of a host in QluMan is its <literal>Cluster node
      name</literal>, which is its name shown in the Enclosure View tree. By convention and
      default, the head-node is named <emphasis>beosrv-c</emphasis> and the FrontEnd node
      <emphasis>login-c</emphasis>. Note, that these are their names in the cluster-internal
      boot network and not their real hostname (displayed by the <command>hostname</command>
      command). Per default, compute nodes are named <emphasis>beo-&#60;N&#62;</emphasis> with
      <emphasis>&#60;N&#62;</emphasis> being a two-digit running number and their
      <literal>Cluster node name</literal> will also be used as their real hostname.
    </para>
    <warning>
      <para>
	We strongly advise to keep the head-node <literal>Cluster node name</literal>
	<emphasis>beosrv-c</emphasis>. There are a lot of places where this name is hard-coded
	and changing it will likely cause problems.
      </para>
    </warning>
    <para>
      A host's <literal>Cluster node name</literal> will always resolve to its IP in the boot
      network. It is also used as the stem, when the name of the host in networks slaved to the
      boot network is generated with the configured pre-/suffix of the slave. E.g. per default,
      the name in the IPMI network has a suffix of <emphasis>ipmi</emphasis>, which means that
      a host with <literal>Cluster node name</literal> <emphasis>beo-01</emphasis> will become
      <emphasis>beo-01-ipmi</emphasis> in the IPMI network.
    </para>
    <para>
      Sometimes the generated names are inconvenient to remember, or the network does not have
      generated names at all, when it is neither the boot nor a slave network (e.g. the
      external network of the FrontEnd node). In such cases, a host can be given additional
      names by defining host aliases for it.
    </para>
    <para>
      Even stronger than an alias is the <literal>hostname override</literal>. The hostname
      override does not just add an additional name for the host, but also makes it the real
      hostname that is displayed by the <command>hostname</command> command) and will appear on
      the shell prompt, in logfiles or outgoing mails from that host. This is commonly used for
      FrontEnd nodes, so that the visible name matches the external name of the host that is
      used to connect to it.

      For most practical purposes, <firstterm>Infiniband (IB)</firstterm> adapters need to be
      configured with an IP address (IPoIB) just like Ethernet adapters. If you have chosen to
      configure an IB network during installation, this section is mostly about how to review
      or change the initial settings. If not, a network definition for IB has to be created in
      the <link linkend="sec-Network-Definitions">Networks</link> dialog. There, a network IP
      address and a netmask can be chosen for the IBoIB Network.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Infiniband network must not collide with any other network. This is prevented
      automatically in the settings dialog. It is convenient to define the IB network as a
      slave to the boot network. Then the IB IP of each host is computed by mapping the host
      part of its Boot IP to the IB network and no further configuration is necessary. Example:
      If a host's boot network IP address is 192.168.17.100, the corresponding slaved IB IP
      address will become 192.168.18.100.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
	This mechanism requires the IB netmask to be at least as large as the Boot Network
	netmask. Hence, smaller values won't be selectable.

      In order to have the IB adapter of a node configured correctly during the boot process,
      the network definition must also be added to the Network Config used by the host. It is
      not uncommon, that a cluster consists of hosts with IB and hosts without. In such cases,
      multiple Network Configs must be created (at least one with IB and one without IB) and
      assigned to the different hosts in one of the standard ways (via templates or
      directly). If the Network Config for a host includes a NIC of type
      <emphasis>IB</emphasis>, during its boot process, the necessary Infiniband kernel modules
      will be loaded and IP-over-IB will be set up with the IP mapping configured in the
      network definition.

	In an IB fabric, at least one node (or switch) has to run a subnet manager process that
	manages the IB routing tables. Qlustar provides <application>OpenSM</application> for
	this task. If the head-node is also part of the IB network, it's usually best to
	configure it to run OpenSM. This might have been chosen during installation, in which
	case there is nothing more to be done. If not, you have the option to run OpenSM on

	In this case, it is advisable to run OpenSM on two or three nodes (not more) for

	hosts, rather than using a Host Template or generic property set. After selecting the
	host(s) where OpenSM should run in the Enclosure View, open the context menu and select
	<guimenuitem>Set Generic Property</guimenuitem>-><guimenuitem>OpenSM

      Configuring <firstterm>IPMI</firstterm> is similar to Infiniband and also involves
      multiple steps, because there are a number of options to set. If you have chosen to
      configure an IPMI network during installation, a larger part of this section is about how
      to review or change the initial settings. If not, a network definition for IPMI has to be
      created in the <link linkend="sec-Network-Definitions">Networks</link> dialog.
    </para>
    <para>
      There, an IPMI network address and netmask can be chosen. The IPMI network must not
      collide with any other network. This is prevented automatically in the
      settings dialog. By making the network a slave to the boot network, the IPMI IP of each
      host is computed by mapping the host part of its Boot IP to the IPMI Network. Example:
      If a host's boot network IP address is 192.168.17.100, the corresponding slaved IPMI IP
      address will become 192.168.19.100.

      Just as in the case of an IB adapter, the network definition for IPMI must be added to
      the Network Config used by the host. It is not uncommon, that a cluster consists of hosts
      with IPMI and hosts without. In such cases, multiple Network Configs must be created (at
      least one with IPMI and one without IPMI) and assigned to the different hosts in one of
      the standard ways (via templates or directly). If the Network Config for a host includes
      a NIC of type <emphasis>IPMI</emphasis>, the node is ready for monitoring its
      temperature and fan speeds.

      Enabling IPMI nodes for remote control involves one more setting: The generic property
      <parameter>Initialize IPMI</parameter>. Per default, the settings of the IPMI cards are
      not touched by <productname>Qlustar</productname> as they retain their configuration
      across boot. However, if the <parameter>Initialize IPMI</parameter> generic property is
      assigned and set to <parameter>true</parameter>, the IPMI card network settings of the
      corresponding host will be set every time it boots. Changing the value of this property

      allows a one-time setup of the card's network properties.
