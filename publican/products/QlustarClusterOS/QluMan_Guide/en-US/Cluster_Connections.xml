      When starting <application>qluman-qt</application>, it asks for the password to your
      certificate safe.  The certificate safe contains the login informations for your
      clusters and private keys for each account. The password for the certificate safe is
      required on every start and whenever changes to the safe need to be safed. You can have
      the client remember the password for the duration it is running by checking the
      <classname>Remember password</classname> checkbox. If you are starting
      <application>qluman-qt</application> for the first time and therefore have no
      certificate safe yet this dialog is skipped and an empty <classname>Connect
      Cluster</classname> dialog opens directly. See <xref linkend="sec-add-cluster"/>
      below about how to add a new cluster.

	  caption: Connect Cluster Dialog)-->
      <!--cbox(file: connect_cluster_dialog/select_cluster.png
	  caption: Select a Cluster Connection)-->
      Having entered the correct password for the certificate safe the <classname>Connect
      Cluster</classname> dialog opens. The last cluster used will be pre-selected but a
      different cluster can be selected from the drop-down menu. Click the
      <guibutton>Connect</guibutton> button to connect to the selected cluster.
      <!--cbox(file: first_steps/saving_key.png
	  caption: )-->
      If this is the first time you connect to the cluster, the client generates a random
      public and private key pair, that will eventually be used for permanent authentification
      of the chosen user with this cluster. It then connects to the server and tries to
      authenticate itself using the one-time token. On success, the server stores the public
      key of the client for future logins and the client stores both the private and public
      keys in the certificate safe finalizing the initial handshake.
      <note>
	<para>
	  The GUI client asks for the password for the certificate safe to store the generated
	  public/private key pair. It will only do this when you initially connect with a
	  one-time token. For future connections, the stored key pair will be used to connect
	  and authenticate. The safe contents will then not be changed again.

      The <classname>Manage Clusters</classname> dialog manages all your acounts on different
      clusters or as different users. It allows adding new cluster acounts, editing existing
      acounts or removing obsolete acounts as well as changing the password for the
      certificate safe. It can be opened by clicking <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> in the
      <classname>Connect Cluster</classname> dialog.

	To add a new cluster click the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button and select

	Paste the one-time token data into the dialog and click <guibutton>Decrypt</guibutton>
	or select the file for the token. When asked for the password enter the pin you used
	when creating the token. The dialog should then show the server infos that where
	included with the one-time token. If you started <application>qluman-qt</application>
	on your workstation then you might have to change the <parameter>Local
	Hostname</parameter> to use the external name of the head-node. Similarly if you
	changed the port for qlumand you have to adjust that too. The
	<parameter>Alias</parameter> is the name the cluster will use in the drop-down menu in
	the <classname>Connect Cluster</classname> dialog. Click <guibutton>Ok</guibutton> to
	add the cluster connection.

	the <guibutton>Remember password</guibutton> checkbox was enabled.

	When dealing with multiple clusters the clusters can be reordered using drag&amp;drop
	to move them to the desired location in the list. Clusters can also be grouped together
	by first creating a new group and then dragging the cluster into the group. The tree
	structure in the <classname>Manage Clusters</classname> dialog will be reflected in the
	drop-down menu in the <classname>Connect Cluster</classname> dialog. This allows even
	large installations with multiple cluster to remain managable for the admin. Normal
	users will most likely not need this feature.
