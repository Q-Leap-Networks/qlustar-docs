      The <classname>Enclosure View</classname> shows an overview of the cluster in a tree
      structure. The tree is designed to reflect the physical structure of the
      cluster. At the lowest level are the hosts. A host can be a head, storage or compute
      node but also a switch e.g. In general, anything in the cluster that has a name, IP and
      MAC address is a host.
    </para>
    <para>
      A host is represented by its <literal>bare board</literal> and
      should be placed into a <firstterm> host enclosure</firstterm>. 1U, 2U, 3U or 4U
      enclosures contain exactly one board, while others like a Twin or Blade chassis can
      have multiple boards. Once defined, host enclosures can be placed into
      <firstterm>racks</firstterm>, racks grouped into rows, rows into rooms and so on. The
      tree has a simple drag&amp;drop interface. E.g. you can select a number of nodes (by
      holding the <keycap>CTRL</keycap> key and clicking or holding the <keycap>shift
      key</keycap> and dragging the mouse) and drag&amp;drop them into a <firstterm>Blade
      enclosure</firstterm>.

	To complete the change of the hostname, the network that the chosen new hostname should

	In the center of the window, the host's individual network config is shown. Initially,
	only the boot network is visible, as shown in the screenshot. Clicking the
	<guibutton>&#62;</guibutton> button will display the complete list of networks assigned
	to the host through its Network Config. For each network, the Host IP, MAC address and

      <para>
	While editing a field, the label corresponding to it, will change color indicating the
	validity and state of the information entered so far. A green label means that the
	current input is a valid choice, but has not been saved yet. A yellow label means that
	the input is incomplete, but can still be completed to become valid (this only applies
	to the MAC address field, in case a partial address is entered). A red label indicates
	that the current input is invalid and can not be used.
      </para>
      <para>
	The tool-tip, displayed when the mouse moves on top of the label, states the reason,
	why the entered value is invalid. The most likely reason is, that the input is already
	used by another host. The node name, hostname override, the host IPs, MAC
	addresses and aliases must all be unique.

	Along with the color coding of the label, the <guibutton>save</guibutton> button will
	also become enabled and change color, whenever a field is edited and not yet saved. It
	will turn red if any of the changes are invalid, even if some of them are. Again, the
	tool-tip will point to the reason why values are invalid. Changes can be saved by
	pressing return in the text field or by clicking the <guibutton>save</guibutton>

     <para>
       For nodes that are not part of a <literal>multi-host enclosure</literal> (like a Blade
       or Twin chassis) the enclosure type can be changed to one of the single-slot host
       enclosures (1U, 2U, etc.). A new enclosure of the chosen type will then be created if
       the node is not already part of one. If a node is included in a multi-host enclosure,
       this field will be ghosted.
     </para>
     <para>
       The template field allows to select a so-called <link linkend="Host-Templates">Host
       Template</link> for the node. Usually, large groups of nodes have an identical hardware
       and software configuration and will use the same template. Deviations from the
       properties coming from the template can be set for individual hosts by direct assignment
       of either a property/config set or individual properties/configs directly to the host
       through its context menu. In case of unique properties, direct assignments override
       settings from the template (or property set), for non-unique properties this is
       additive.
       <note>
	 <para>
	   Any changes made in the configuration only affect the active node (as indicated by
	   the hostname in the info part of the enclosure view), and not all selected
	   nodes. Configurations for all selected nodes can be made by using the context menu
	   (right click) in the tree view.

      Similar to host nodes, selecting an enclosure entry displays the physical layout of the
      corresponding enclosure on the right. Controls to select the visibility level and
      special slots are available at the top of the display. See below for more details about
      these. The name of the enclosure and its type (in brackets) is shown in the title. In
      the above case, both name and type are "Twin². Below the title you have a
      representation of the physical layout of the enclosure. For this example, you see the
      2x2 slots that are characteristic of a

      Selecting a rack shows a more complex picture. The current example rack holds ten
      enclosures in its central 19 inch slots: A FatTwin, a Twin, a Twin², a Blade 1, 3 Blade
      2, another Twin² and two 1U enclosures containing <systemitem
      class="systemname">beo-11</systemitem> and <systemitem
      class="systemname">beo-12</systemitem>. The special top, left, right and bottom (not
      visible) slots are empty. In future versions a network switch or power controller, that
      is mounted at some special position of the rack, can be placed into these special
      slots.

      Now let's explain the effect of the two controls at the top in more detail: The
      <guibutton>Show special slots</guibutton> check-box controls the visibility of the top,
      left, right and bottom special slots. Especially if these slots are empty, this will
      provide a more compact view of the interesting central slots. The other control, the
      visibility level, controls how many levels of the enclosure hierarchy are shown:
      Selecting a depth of 2 shows not only the selected rack with its slots but also the
      contents of the enclosures in each slot.
    </para>
    <para>
      Since the current version of <application>QluMan</application> only supports host
      enclosures (Twin, Blade, ...) and racks, a depth larger than 2 has no effect yet. In
      future versions, it will be possible to group racks into rows, rows into rooms, rooms
      into buildings and so on. This will allow you to reflect the physical layout of your
      cluster in as much detail, as you like.

	Suitable for ordinary servers, a host being selected in the enclosure view can be
	placed into a single slot host enclosure directly by selecting the correct type in
	the host info part of the window (see <xref linkend="sec-Enclosure-View"/>). For host
	enclosures that can hold more than one server/node (twin servers, blades etc.),
	drag&amp;drop may be used to move hosts into them. Moreover, it's also possible to
	create larger (non-host) enclosures (like racks) and move host enclosures into them
	also by using using drag&amp;drop. Note, that a bare host cannot be placed directly
	into a non-host enclosure, only if it is already inside a host enclosure.
      </para>
      <para>
	Another option to place hosts into enclosures is by selecting a number of them and
	then choosing a host enclosure from the context menu. This way, a new enclosure of
	the selected type is automatically created and all selected hosts are moved into
	it. If more hosts than can fit into a single enclosure of the chosen type are
	selected, additional enclosures of the same type will be created such that all hosts
	can be placed into one of them. This makes it easy to position large numbers of
	identical hosts into their enclosures. If the selected hosts were in an enclosure
	before and that enclosure becomes empty and is not itself part of a larger enclosure
	then the empty enclosure is automatically removed.

	Relocating hosts by selecting a different host enclosure is supported not only on
	directly selected hosts but also on hosts inside selected enclosures. This allows
	changing the type of enclosure a group of hosts is in by selecting the old
	enclosure(s) and choosing a new one from the context menu. Note that this procedure
	does not change the type of the old enclosure but rather creates a new one, moves all
	the hosts to it and then deletes the now empty old enclosure(s).

	Try it out: Place a number of hosts into a large enclosure (like a blade), then select
	the enclosure and choose a small enclosure (like 1U) to relocate them. In general, such
	an operation will create one enclosure of the new type and fill all its slots before
	creating a second one. Hosts having been in different enclosures before, can end up in
	the same enclosure and hosts that were in the same enclosure before can end up in
	different enclosures after this operation.
      </para>
      <para>
	When using drag&amp;drop for the relocation, the host or enclosure is always placed
	into the lowest suitable slot of the target enclosure. This reflects our experience,
	that usually enclosures are simply filled from left to right and bottom to top.

	But sometimes this is not the case and a host or enclosure should be in a different
	slot as compared to the automatic placement. In this case, the host or enclosure can be
	moved through the context menu. The latter shows all the free slots the host or
	enclosure can be relocated to and a checked mark indicates the current location. Of
	course the relocation is only allowed into free slots. Hence, it may require removing
	(drag&amp;drop out of the enclosure) a host or enclosure temporarily to free space for
	moving things around.

	  There are situations, where one wants to change a property or config of a whole set
	  of hosts. For example, you may want to change all nodes located in a particular blade
	  to no longer format their disk on boot. This can be achieved by selecting a set of
	  hosts in the enclosure view with the mouse. A range of hosts can be selected by
	  clicking on the first host and then clicking on the last host, while pressing the
	  shift key. Hosts can also be added or removed from the selection by clicking on a
	  host while pressing the <keycap>CTRL</keycap> key. Once a set of hosts is selected,
	  changes can be made to all selected hosts through the context menu. For instance,
	  this allows changing the Host Template or add/alter a generic property of a set of
	  hosts.
