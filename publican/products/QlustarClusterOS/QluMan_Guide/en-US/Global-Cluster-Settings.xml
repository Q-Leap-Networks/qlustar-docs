      To be able to configure your cluster with <application>QluMan</application>, a license
      key needs to be installed. Without a valid key, an error will be displayed upon
      start-up and the QluMan daemon will only allow read-only operations. In read-only mode,
      you can have a look at all the settings, but you can't change anything.
    </para>
    <para>
      After closing the error dialog the License Key window can be opened by selecting
      <guimenuitem>File</guimenuitem>-><guimenuitem>License Key</guimenuitem> in the main
      Menu. If you never installed a license key before, the window will come up mostly
      empty.

      <!--cbox(file: license_key/empty.png)-->
      To request a license key, click the <guibutton>Request Key</guibutton> button and a
      <classname>Key Info Dialog</classname> will open asking you for your name and address
      info. If you intend to use <classname>Qlustar Basic Edition</classname>, checkmark
      <guibutton>Free / non-profit license</guibutton> at the bottom of the dialog. Select
      <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to continue saving the key request in a file. Enter a
      file-name and save. You will now have to send an e-mail specifying the required number
      of nodes and features (see <link xlink:href="http://qlustar.com/order/___blank___">our
      order page</link>) with this key file attached to <link
      xlink:href="mailto:order@q-leap.com?Subject=License%20request">order@q-leap.com</link>
    </para>
    <para>
      <!--cbox(file: license_key/key.png)-->
      After a while, you will receive a license key by mail that you can import using the
      <guibutton>Import Key</guibutton> button. If the import was successful, the license
      information will be displayed and you're ready to start working with
      <application>QluMan</application>.
    </para>
    <para>
      After a successful license installation, you can move on to the interesting stuff. Upon
      start-up, the QluMan client automatically connects to the local QluMan daemon and opens
      the <classname>Enclosure View</classname> window.

    <para>
      <!--cbox(file: main_window__network_config.png)-->
      During the installation of Qlustar, the configuration parameters for the cluster
      network had to be entered and normally you won't need to change them. For the rare
      circumstances, where they do need to be changed, or in case you just want to verify the
      settings, you can select <guibutton>Manage Cluster</guibutton>-><guibutton>Network
      Config</guibutton> from the main windows menu.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
	Note, that changing anything in this dialog involves a fundamental reconfiguration of
	the cluster setup, including rebooting the whole cluster. For this reason, changes in
	the <classname>Global Cluster Network Config</classname> do not take effect immediately
	after being changed in the dialog. They require a further confirmation by clicking the
	<guibutton>Save</guibutton> button, that will then actually commit the changes.

      Configuring Ethernet
    </bridgehead>
    <para>
      <!--cbox(file: network_config__ethernet.png)-->
      Changing the Ethernet network configuration is the most involved and requires several
      steps. In the <classname>Global Cluster Network Config</classname> there are 3 settings
      relevant for <firstterm>Ethernet</firstterm>: The Cluster Network IP address, the
      netmask and the cluster internal Head IP address. When changing the Cluster Network IP
      address or netmask, the IP addresses of all hosts configured in QluMan will be remapped
      to reflect their new values. This requires that the new netmask is large enough, so
      that the resulting network range can include all existing hosts in the
      cluster. Therefore, the GUI won't let you pick anything too small. If there are unused
      address ranges in your existing network and you need a smaller netmask than currently
      selectable, you will first have to change some host addresses so that all of them
      combined occupy a small enough subset of the current network.
    </para>
    <para>
      Changing the network address IP will automatically remap the cluster internal Head IP
      address as well, while changing the netmask will not. Note, that the Qlustar
      convention, to use the second last IP of the cluster network as the Head IP, is
      obviously not a requirement. Hence, this is not done automatically when changing the
      netmask. Furthermore, changing the Head IP involves some additional steps without which
      the nodes in the cluster won't function or even boot. The point is that the Head IP
      also appears in the <classname>Global DHCP Template</classname>, NIS Host header and
      SSH Hosts / Known Hosts. These templates are simple, freely editable text blobs. A
      change of the Head IP in the <classname>Global Cluster Network Config</classname> will
      not change them, so you need to check and adjust each of them manually.
    </para>
    <para>
      <!--cbox(file: network_config__proxy.png)-->
      If the head-node does not have direct access to the Internet, a <parameter>http
      proxy</parameter> must be configured. Qluman uses this proxy to download packages from
      the <guilabel>Qlustar repository</guilabel>, when creating a new chroot. Click the
      checkmark before <guilabel>Http Proxy</guilabel> to enable proxy support and enter the
      hostname together with the port of the proxy. If the proxy requires authentication,
      click the checkmark before <guilabel>Authenticate</guilabel> and enter a username and
      password. Like usual, the new settings will only take affect, when you click the
      <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button.
