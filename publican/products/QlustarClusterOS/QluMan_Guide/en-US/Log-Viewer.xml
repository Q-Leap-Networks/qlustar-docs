    <para>
      QluMan comes with a <classname>Log Viewer</classname> that allows to inspect important
      events in the cluster. Messages are categorized depending on the type of event, when it
      occurred, which component(s) it involved and how important it was.

      At the right bottom of the main window the QluMan GUI displays a
      <guibutton>Messages</guibutton> indicator. The button shows the highest priority of
      uninspected messages, as well as their number. Clicking the button opens the
      <emphasis>Messages</emphasis> window. The <emphasis>Messages</emphasis> window can also
      be opened through the <guimenuitem>Manage Cluster -> Messages</guimenuitem> menu item.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
	As time goes on, the number of saved messages rises, using up more and more space in
	the database. More serious, all the messages are transmitted to the GUI client when
	connecting. Having more than 1000 messages starts to introduce a noticeable delay. More
	than about 30000 saved messages can become really problematic, causing timeouts on
	connect. It is therefore recommended to review and clear messages from time to time. Be
	aware, that deleting several 1000 messages will take quite some time.

      Opening the Messages window shows a list of messages sorted by time, the oldest message
      displayed at the top. The messages can be sorted ascending and descending by clicking on
      any of the column headers. Only the short text of each message is shown to keep the
      window compact. Hovering over a row will show the long text for that row as a tool-tip.
      The long text can also be seen in a separate window by clicking the
      <guibutton>Details</guibutton> button. The extra window makes it easier to read
      multi-line messages and allows copy+paste.
    </para>
    <para>
      Starting with Qluman 11.0.2.8 some new message categories were added to better track
      what happens on the cluster with multiple admins. Creating, clonening or removing a chroot
      now adds a message in the Chroot cathegory. For slurm users starting, stopping or restarting
      slurmd on a node will now add a message.
    </para>
    <!--cbox(file: messages/messages-execution.png caption: Message for command execution)-->
    <para>
      Command execution is now also logged in Messages. For command execution the origin is the name
      of the user executing the command. The short message contains the hosts the command was executed
      on as either a hostlist or a filter followed by the command. For predefined commands the alias
      of the command is shown instead of the actual command. The actual list of hosts the command
      was executed as well as the full command text can be seen in the tooltip or by clicking the
      <guibutton>Details</guibutton> button.
    </para>
    <!--cbox(file: messages/messages-offline.png caption: Tooltips show more information)-->
    <para>
    Last but not least the messages for the Online category have been greatly reduced in number
    but not in information. For example when restarting Qlumand the messages of individual host
    reconnecting has been surpressed and after a short time a single message is added with a
    summary of nodes that have reconnected or failed to do so. The full list of nodes can be
    seen in the tooltip or by clicking the <guibutton>Details</guibutton> button.
    </para>
    <para>
      Not just the message flood when restarting qlumand has been reduced but also when the cluster
      boots or nodes are rebooted, as can be seen in the screenshot. Instead of one message per node
      going offline or coming online the messages are now merged within a short timeframe. The
      origin for the merged message shows the hostlist of nodes in compact form while the tooltip
      or detail view gives a host by host list with individual timestamps. Reducing the amount of
      messages on node restarts allowed adding a new message <emphasis role="bold">Host
      booting</emphasis> to the Online category, listing hosts that are downloading the Qlustar
      image at the moment.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
	Merged messages are shown with a timestamp of the last entry. This means that it is possible
	for messages to appear out of order. For example the Host online message for hosts can appear
	before the Host booting message if the last node in Host booting hasn't come online (yet). If
	in doubt compare the individual timestamps for each host.

      Not every message is of interest to a user, especially messages that have already been
      seen. Therefore, each user can create his own filter for messages by clicking on the
      <guibutton>Edit Filter</guibutton> button. A filter consist of a number of matches shown
      as rows, with an action, as well as a default action. The filtering process goes through
      the rows one by one. If all fields set in a row match a message, then the action set for
      that row is executed: Either the message will be hidden or included in the messages
      window. If none of the rows match a message, the default action applies to it.
    </para>
    <para>
      There is one message filter per cluster connection tab. It can be freely edited. The
      message filter remains in effect till the tab for the cluster is closed. The filter can
      also be saved as a user-specific setting, so it is reloaded the next time a connection to
      the cluster is opened again. Alternatively, the filter can be reset to the last saved
      config or cleared so that the viewer starts without any filtering.

	A new filter row can be added by selecting <guimenuitem>Add filter</guimenuitem> from

	column should be changed through the context menu, to match only some messages. The
	context menu in each column contains the possible values the filter can match against
	in that column. The <emphasis>Origin</emphasis> and <emphasis>Short</emphasis>
	columns can also be edited freely by double clicking them. The action for the row can

 	The most common filter is to hide messages with the <emphasis>Seen</emphasis> flag. It
 	is recommended, to always start a new filter by adding a row with action
 	<emphasis>Hide</emphasis> and the seen column set to <emphasis>Seen</emphasis>.  If
 	none of the filter rows match against the <emphasis>Seen</emphasis> flag, then it will
 	have no effect in the <classname>Messages window</classname>.  The
 	<emphasis>Seen</emphasis> filter can also be toggled between <emphasis>Seen</emphasis>
 	and <emphasis>Unseen</emphasis> by clicking the checkmark. The column can only be
 	disabled by selecting <emphasis>Ignore</emphasis> from the context menu.

	Messages can be purely informational, warnings or errors. Informational messages
	include information about nodes coming online or the server being restarted. There are
	usually a lot of informational messages and they can be safely ignored. On the other
	hand, warnings and errors should be inspected more carefully. In the Log Viewer, the
	priority of a message is <emphasis role="bold">color-coded</emphasis> for quicker
	visual recognition. Informational messages are green, warnings yellow and errors
	red. The highest priority of any shown message is also shown in the
	<guibutton>Messages</guibutton> button in the lower right corner of the main
	window. This indicates at a single glance, if anything important happened recently.

	Messages fall into different categories, pooling similar messages for easier
	filtering. Generally information is categorized under <emphasis>Misc</emphasis>, while
	messages about nodes becoming online or going offline under category
	<emphasis>Online</emphasis>. The <emphasis>Licensing</emphasis> category includes all
	messages concerning changes in the license status. This could be something simple as a
	reminder that the license key expires soon. Or more important, a warning or error, that
	the cluster, as currently configured, exceeds the available license count. The last
	category is <emphasis>Exception</emphasis>. It usually signals a software error, that

      </mediaobject>
	The example filter shows a more involved setup: It contains five rows showing how rows
	can be combined to achieve the desired filtering result. The default action for this
	filter is set to <emphasis>show messages</emphasis>. Hence, only messages that are
	explicitly filtered as <emphasis>not wanted</emphasis> will be hidden.
      </para>
      <para>
	Row 1 excludes messages with the <emphasis>seen</emphasis> flag set. Rows number 2 and
	3 might look odd at first, because their action is the same as the default action:
	<emphasis>Show</emphasis>. But these two rows prevent any of the later rows from hiding
	messages with priority <emphasis>error</emphasis> or
	<emphasis>warning</emphasis>. In other words, warnings and errors will always be
	shown, no matter what additional filter rows follow. Row number 4 hides messages in the
	category <emphasis>online</emphasis> and row 5 hides messages that originate from hosts
	matching the hostlist "vm-[0-9]".
