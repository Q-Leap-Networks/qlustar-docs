    <para>
      The IP configuration of the head-node is defined in the file
      <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> (type <command>man interfaces</command> for
      details), while <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> is the key-control file regarding
      the DNS configuration (see <xref linkend="admin-man-sect-dns"/>). Network interfaces can
      be brought up or down using the commands <command>ifup</command> and
      <command>ifdown</command> (see also the corresponding man pages). Typically, the
      head-node has at least two network interfaces, one for the external LAN and one for the
      internal cluster network. For all cluster-internal networks (boot/NFS, optional
      Infiniband and/or IPMI)<indexterm><primary>Network Configuration</primary>
      <secondary>cluster-internal networks</secondary></indexterm>, unofficial (not routed) IP
      addresses are used, usually in the range
      <parameter>192.168.x.0/255.255.255.0</parameter>, while for larger clusters the range
      <parameter>172.16.y.0/255.255.0.0</parameter> is often used. In the latter case,
      <parameter>y</parameter> might indicate the rack number.
    </para>

      <para>
        The cluster-internal network ranges can be conveniently chosen during installation.

     <para>
       This section describes how to configure the Domain Name System (DNS).
     </para>

     <para>
       The file <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> contains the addresses of the DNS 
       servers to use and a list of domain names to search when looking up a short
       (not fully qualified) hostname.
       Example:
     </para>
     
     <screen>search your.domain
nameserver 10.0.0.252
nameserver 10.0.0.253
     </screen>
     <para>
       where 10.0.0.252 and 10.0.0.253 are the addresses of the DNS servers and your.domain is
       the DNS domain name.
     </para>
     <note>
       <para>
	 Recent versions of Qlustar allow the DNS configuration to be configured directly in
	 <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename>. To make use of this,
	 <parameter>dns-</parameter> option lines need to be added to the relevant iface
	 stanza. The following option names are supported:
	 <parameter>dns-nameservers</parameter>, <parameter>dns-search</parameter>, and
	 <parameter>dns-sortlist</parameter>. Get more details on these options by executing
	 <command>man resolvconf</command>.The <parameter>dns-nameservers</parameter> entry is
	 added and configured automatically during installation.
       </para>
     </note>
     <para>
       If the compute-nodes also need DNS access, they should use the head-node(s) as a
       forward-only DNS server. In that case the package <package>bind9</package> should be
       installed and the addresses of the DNS servers be entered in the file
       <filename>/etc/bind/named.conf.options</filename>. Example:
     </para>
     <screen>
options {
  ...
  forwarders {
    10.0.0.252;
    10.0.0.253;
  };
  ...
     </screen>

     <para>
       The compute-nodes must then use the cluster-internal address of the head-node
       (192.168.52.254 in the example below) as their DNS server. This and the DNS domain name
       have to be entered in the DHCP template file of QluMan as follows, so that the
       compute-nodes may receive the required information via DHCP:
     </para>
     
     <screen>...
option domain-name "your.domain";
option domain-name-servers 192.168.52.254;

    <title>DHCP</title>
    <indexterm><primary>Network Configuration</primary><secondary>DHCP</secondary></indexterm>

    <para>
      The IP configuration of the compute-nodes is done using the Dynamic Host Control Protocol
      (DHCP). The DHCP server is not only responsible to automatically supply the IP address
      and netmask to these nodes, but also additional configuration options like the gateway
      and DNS server addresses, DNS domain name and many other parameters. The DHCP server
      configuration file is <filename>/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</filename> (type <command>man
      dhcpd.conf</command>) and is auto-generated by QluMan. There is a general or global
      section and a per node section in this file. The global section determines values that
      are to be applied to all the nodes registered within the <filename>dhcpd.conf</filename>
      file. On the contrary, the contents of a node section applies only to that specific
      machine and is created from the corresponding host info of the QluMan database. The
      following listing shows the default global section that is automatically generated by
      QluMan during the installation of a Qlustar cluster:
    </para>

       <para>
	 If a cluster has additional internal networks (e.g. Infiniband), the IP address of a
	 node in that network is derived from its basic DHCP address and set automatically
	 during boot. The addresses of additional networks can be specified during installation
	 and in QluMan. Check the &QLUMANGUIDE; for more details.

    <title>IP Masquerading (NAT)</title>
    <indexterm><primary>Network Configuration</primary>
    <secondary>IP Masquerading</secondary></indexterm>
    
  <para>
    IP masquerading (NAT) is configured by default on the head-node(s) during installation, to
    allow the compute-nodes direct TCP/IP connections to machines outside of the internal
    cluster network. This could be necessary e.g., when applications running on the
    compute-nodes need to contact a license server in the public LAN. All IP packets with
    unofficial sender IP addresses and a destination in the public LAN are then translated by
    the head-node to packets with its own official IP address. When a reply packet arrives, it
    is translated back to the unofficial IP address of the originating node inside of the
    cluster. The head-node works as a router in this case. The following section in
    <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> shows, how masquerading is activated on boot
    and disabled on shutdown:
  </para>

iface eth1 inet static
  address 4.4.4.123
  netmask 255.255.0.0
  broadcast 4.4.255.255

    <para>
      Synchronized system time throughout the cluster is very crucial for its flawless
      operation. It is achieved using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon. If the head-node
      has direct Internet access, publicly available time-servers on the Internet can be
      contacted and used as an accurate time reference. In order to set a list of time-servers,
      edit the file <filename>/etc/ntp.conf</filename> and add a line for every ntp-server to
      be contacted:
