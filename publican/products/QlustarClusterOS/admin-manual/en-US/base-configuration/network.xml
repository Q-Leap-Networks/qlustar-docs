    <para>
      The IP configuration of the head-node is defined in the file
      <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> (type <command>man interfaces</command> for
      details), while <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> is the key-control file regarding
      the DNS configuration (see <xref linkend="admin-man-sect-dns"/>). Network interfaces can
      be brought up or down using the commands <command>ifup</command> and
      <command>ifdown</command> (see also the corresponding man pages). Typically, the
      head-node has at least two network interfaces, one for the external LAN and one for the
      internal cluster network. For all cluster-internal networks (boot/NFS, optional
      Infiniband and/or IPMI)<indexterm><primary>Network Configuration</primary>
      <secondary>cluster-internal networks</secondary></indexterm>, unofficial (not routed) IP
      addresses are used, usually in the range
      <parameter>192.168.x.0/255.255.255.0</parameter>, while for larger clusters the range
      <parameter>172.16.y.0/255.255.0.0</parameter> is often used. In the latter case,
      <parameter>y</parameter> might indicate the rack number.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        The cluster-internal network ranges can be conveniently chosen during installation.

     <para>
       The file <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> contains the addresses of the DNS 
       servers to use and a list of domain names to search when looking up a short
       (not fully qualified) hostname.
       Example:
     </para>
     <screen>search your.domain
nameserver 127.0.0.1
     </screen>
     <para>
       where 127.0.0.1 is the localhost address and your.domain is the DNS domain name.
     </para>
     <note>
       <para>
	 The file <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> is automatically generated. The DNS
	 configuration must be configured directly in
	 <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> by adding <parameter>dns-</parameter>
	 option lines to the relevant iface stanza. The following option names are supported:
	 <parameter>dns-nameservers</parameter>, <parameter>dns-search</parameter>, and
	 <parameter>dns-sortlist</parameter>. Get more details on these options by executing
	 <command>man resolvconf</command>. The <parameter>dns-nameservers</parameter> entry is
	 added and configured automatically to use 127.0.0.1 (the head-node's dnsmasq instance)
	 during installation.

    <para>
      The basic IP configuration of the compute-nodes is done using the Dynamic Host Control
      Protocol (DHCP). The DHCP server is not only responsible to automatically supply the IP
      address and netmask to these nodes, but also additional configuration options like the
      gateway and DNS server addresses, DNS domain name and many other parameters. Starting
      from Qlustar 11.0, <application>dnsmasq</application> is also used to provide DHCP
      services. The corresponding configuration file is
      <filename>/etc/dnsmasq.d/01-dhcpd.conf</filename> and is auto-generated by QluMan.
    </para>
     <note>
       <para>
	 If a cluster has additional internal networks (e.g. Infiniband), the IP address of a
	 node in that network is derived from its basic DHCP address and set automatically
	 during boot. The addresses of additional networks can be specified during installation
	 and in QluMan. Check the <link
	 xlink:href="../QluMan_Guide/index.html#chap-Cluster-Network-Setup___blank___">QluMan
	 Guide</link> for more details.

    <title>IP Masquerading (NAT)</title>
    <indexterm><primary>Network Configuration</primary>
    <secondary>IP Masquerading</secondary></indexterm>
    <para>
      To allow direct TCP/IP connections for the compute-nodes to machines outside of the
      internal cluster network, IP masquerading (NAT) is configured by default on the
      head-node(s) during installation. This might be necessary e.g., when applications
      running on the compute-nodes need to contact a license server in the public LAN.
    </para>
    <para>
      All IP packets with unofficial sender IP addresses and a destination in the public LAN
      are then translated by the head-node to packets with its own official IP address. When a
      reply packet arrives, it is translated back to the unofficial IP address of the
      originating node inside of the cluster. The head-node works as a router in this case. The
      following example section in <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> (cluster
      network address is 192.168.97.0/24) shows, how masquerading is activated on boot and
      disabled on shutdown:
    </para>
    <screen>
iface br-ext inet static
  address 192.168.55.44
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  broadcast 192.168.55.255
  gateway 192.168.55.254

  bridge_fd 0
  bridge_maxwait 0
  up iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.97.0/24 \
    -o br-ext -j MASQUERADE

    <para>
      Synchronized system time throughout the cluster is crucial for its flawless operation. It
      is achieved using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon. If the head-node has direct
      Internet access, publicly available time-servers on the Internet can be contacted and
      used as an accurate time reference. In order to set a list of time-servers, edit the file
      <filename>/etc/ntp.conf</filename> and add a line for every ntp-server (example ntp-1) to
      be contacted:
    </para>
