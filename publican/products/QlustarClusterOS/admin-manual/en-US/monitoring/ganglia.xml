    Nagios in combination with Ganglia is used to monitor the hardware of the compute
    nodes as well as the head node.

    <para>
      In older installations a process ql-hwmonitor was responsible to check the ganglia
      metrics against the thresholds defined in the files
      <filename>/etc/ql-lib/hw-monitor/resources</filename> and
      <filename>/etc/ql-lib/hw-monitor/resources.ganglia</filename>. This was completely
      replaced by a Nagios configuration. It turned out that that did not scale very well, so a
      new daemon process ql-hwmonitord in combination with Nagios is used now.  This daemon now
      checks the information provided in ganglia, checks them against service limits and sends
      the results to Nagios.

      Each node sends sensor data and other information such as swap usage, fill level of file
      systems and S.M.A.R.T. data of the hard disks to a multicast address where the head node
      can collect them. The way each node collects the sensor data depends on the hardware
      type. The Qlustar Cluster Suite detects the type that is suitable for a specific compute
      node. You can list the current metrics by running <command>ganglia --help</command>.  The
      package <package>ganglia-webfrontend</package> allows to view the state of your cluster
      and each node from within a web-browser. It suffices to visit the Link
      <literal>http://<replaceable>head-node</replaceable>/ganglia</literal>.
