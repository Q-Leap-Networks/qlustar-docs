A Qlustar HPC cluster is designed to boot and manage hosts over the network and use any
local disk only to preserve logfiles across boots and for temporary storage for jobs. One
or more boot server provide boot images to the hosts as well as a small NFS share
containing configurations for the hosts. Optionally a chroot can be exported and used by
the hosts to support software not already contained in the boot images themself. The boot
server also provide PXE, DHCP, Nis, torque and slurm services to the cluster. All of this
can be easily managed through Qluman, the Qlustar Management interface.
